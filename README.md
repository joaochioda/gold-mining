# WIP - Simple gaming on blockchain

## Backend - Blockchain

## Frontend - Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS v4

## Infos
- To access the project, you need to connect to the[BSC Testnet](https://medium.com/spartanprotocol/how-to-connect-metamask-to-bsc-testnet-7d89c111ab2)
- The first worker ($1) is free.
- You need to have BNB (Testnet) in your wallet to make transactions.

## Mechanics:

You will receive a worker (NFT) that mines X gold per second. Over time, you can buy more workers or machines that are more efficient.
